        "2. **Geographical Location**: We will examine the location declared in user profiles to observe if there are emotional variations based on geographic regions.\n",
        "3. **Interactions (Likes and Retweets)**: We will consider the number of likes and retweets tweets receive as indicators of their emotional impact on the audience.\n",
        "4. **Tweet Creation Date**: We will investigate if there are seasonal or daily patterns in the emotions expressed over time.\n",
        "5. **Sentiment**: We will use a trained sentiment model to make a prediction of what feelings is describing through the tweet.\n",
